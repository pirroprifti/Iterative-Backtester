<h1>Iterative Backtester</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project introduces quantitative trading concepts through a simple momentum-based strategy and backtesting framework. Specifically, it explores the application of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to a tech stock, Google, over the course of a year (2023-2024). The backtest demonstrates the viability of the strategy, providing a foundation for further exploration and development of quantitative trading techniques and investment hypotheses.
